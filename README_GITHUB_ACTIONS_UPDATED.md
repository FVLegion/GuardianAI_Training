- **Advanced Regularization**: Weight decay, learning rate scheduling, gradient clipping
- **Data Augmentation**: Noise injection for better generalization
- **Robust Architecture**: Layer normalization, attention dropout
- **Smart Deployment**: Automatic model publishing with production tags

### 📊 Pipeline Components

#### 1. **Dataset Setup** (`download_and_setup_dataset`)
- ✅ Detects your existing dataset at `/home/sagemaker-user/data/Guardian_Dataset`
- ✅ Creates symlinks in GitHub Actions workspace
- ✅ Validates dataset structure and content

#### 2. **Data Preparation** (`prepare_data`)
- ✅ Loads and preprocesses keypoint data
- ✅ Applies normalization and temporal smoothing
- ✅ Handles train/validation/test splits

#### 3. **Baseline Training** (`train_bilstm_github`)
- ✅ Full BiLSTM with enhanced attention
- ✅ 50 epochs, 256 hidden units, 4 layers
- ✅ Advanced regularization and optimization
- ✅ Real-time metrics logging

#### 4. **Hyperparameter Optimization** (`bilstm_hyperparam_optimizer_github`)
- ✅ **30 trials** with RandomSearch
- ✅ Comprehensive search space (13 hyperparameters)
- ✅ Concurrent execution (2 tasks)
- ✅ Automatic best model selection

#### 5. **Model Evaluation** (`evaluate_model_github`)
- ✅ Test set evaluation with best model
- ✅ Confusion matrix generation
- ✅ Per-class precision/recall/F1 metrics
- ✅ Classification report

#### 6. **Model Deployment** (`deploy_model_github`)
- ✅ Automatic deployment if accuracy ≥ 85%
- ✅ Production tags and metadata
- ✅ Model publishing to ClearML

### 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflow

#### **Job 1: `run-pipeline`**
- Dataset symlink creation
- ClearML configuration verification
- Complete pipeline execution (all 6 components)

#### **Job 2: `deploy-model`** (NEW!)
- Checks deployment status
- Reports model metrics
- Confirms production deployment
- Provides model URLs and metadata

### 📈 Expected Results

Based on your previous successful run (95.40% validation accuracy), you can expect:

- **Baseline Model**: ~95% validation accuracy
- **HPO Optimization**: Potential improvement to 96-98%
- **Test Accuracy**: 94-97% (depending on optimization)
- **Deployment**: ✅ Automatic (well above 85% threshold)

### 🎯 Hyperparameter Search Space

The HPO explores:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001 to 0.01 (continuous)
- **Hidden Size**: 128, 192, 256, 320, 384, 512
- **Layers**: 2, 3, 4, 5
- **Dropout**: 0.05 to 0.5 (continuous)
- **Epochs**: 30, 40, 50, 60
- **Batch Size**: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-6 to 1e-3 (continuous)
- **Scheduler Patience**: 3, 5, 7, 10
- **Scheduler Factor**: 0.2 to 0.8 (continuous)
- **Gradient Clipping**: 0.5 to 3.0 (continuous)
- **Noise Factor**: 0.0 to 0.05 (continuous)
- **Layer Normalization**: True/False
- **Attention Dropout**: 0.0 to 0.2 (continuous)

### 🔍 Monitoring & Results

#### **ClearML Dashboard**
- **Project**: `Guardian_Training`
- **Pipeline**: `Guardian_Pipeline_GitHub`
- **HPO Controller**: `BiLSTM_HPO_GitHub_Controller`
- **Evaluation**: `Evaluate_Best_Model_GitHub`
- **Deployment**: `Deploy_Best_Model_GitHub`

#### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- Validation accuracy progression during HPO
- Test accuracy on final evaluation
- Deployment status (deployed/not_deployed)
- Model performance across action classes

### 🚀 How to Run

1. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Enhanced pipeline with full Guardian functionality"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - GitHub Actions will show both jobs
   - Check logs for detailed progress
   - ClearML dashboard for metrics and visualizations

3. **Expected execution time**: 2-4 hours (depending on HPO results)

### 📊 Sample Output

```
🎉 Guardian AI GitHub Pipeline Completed! 🎉
⏱️  Total Execution Time: 180.45 minutes
🎯 Final Test Accuracy: 96.85%
🚀 Deployment Status: deployed
✅ Model successfully deployed to production!
```

### 🏷️ Model Deployment

Successfully deployed models will have:
- **Tags**: `["deployed", "production", "github-actions"]`
- **Status**: Published in ClearML
- **Metadata**: Test accuracy, deployment date, threshold info
- **Accessibility**: Ready for inference and production use

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the enhanced pipeline** and monitor results
2. **Check ClearML dashboard** for detailed metrics and visualizations
3. **Use deployed model** for inference in your applications
4. **Iterate and improve** based on results

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check dataset symlink**: Ensure `/home/sagemaker-user/data/Guardian_Dataset` exists
2. **Verify ClearML credentials**: Check secrets are properly configured
3. **Monitor resource usage**: HPO requires significant compute
4. **Check logs**: Both GitHub Actions and ClearML provide detailed logging
