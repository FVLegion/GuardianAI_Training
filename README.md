# Guardian AI Training Pipeline

A comprehensive ClearML-powered training pipeline for human action recognition using BiLSTM with attention mechanism.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains the Guardian AI training pipeline that recognizes human actions (Falling, No Action, Waving) from pose keypoint data using:
- **BiLSTM with Attention** for temporal sequence modeling
- **ClearML** for experiment tracking and dataset management
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** for automated model tuning
- **GitHub Actions** with self-hosted GPU runners for CI/CD
- **MongoDB** for model distribution and versioning

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner with GPU
- ClearML account and API credentials
- Python 3.11+
- CUDA-compatible GPU
- MongoDB Atlas account (for model distribution)

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   ```
   CLEARML_API_ACCESS_KEY
   CLEARML_API_SECRET_KEY
   CLEARML_API_HOST

   MONGODB_DATABASE
   ```

2. **Set up Self-hosted Runner**:
   - Install GitHub Actions runner on your GPU machine
   - Add labels: `[self-hosted, guardian, gpu]`
   - Ensure GPU drivers and CUDA are installed

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Trigger Pipeline**:
   - Push to `main` branch
   - Close a pull request to `main`
   - Manual trigger via GitHub Actions "Run workflow" button

- **Configuration Management**: Store and retrieve model hyperparameters

### Using the Model Downloader

```bash
# List all available models
python download_guardian_model.py --list

# Download the best model (highest accuracy)
python download_guardian_model.py --best

# Download a specific model by name
python download_guardian_model.py --model guardian_model_12345678_95

# Interactive mode
python download_guardian_model.py --interactive
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run local pipeline
python Guardian_pipeline.py

# Run GitHub-optimized pipeline locally
python Guardian_pipeline_github.py

# Configure model distribution
cp .secrets.example .secrets
# Edit .secrets with your MongoDB credentials
```

## üîÑ GitHub Actions Workflow

The repository includes a complete CI/CD pipeline that:
- Automatically triggers on code changes
- Runs on self-hosted GPU runners
- Executes the Guardian pipeline
- Uploads results and artifacts
- Provides detailed logging and monitoring
- Deploys models to MongoDB for distribution

## üîó Monitoring & Results

- **ClearML Dashboard**: https://app.clear.ml/
- **GitHub Actions**: Check the Actions tab for pipeline runs
- **Artifacts**: Download training outputs from GitHub Actions
- **Model Registry**: Published models available in ClearML and MongoDB

## üí° Advanced Configuration

### Model Deployment Threshold

The pipeline automatically deploys models that exceed an accuracy threshold:

```python
# In Guardian_pipeline_github.py
deployment_status = deploy_model_github(
    best_model_id=best_model_id,
    best_model_path=best_model_path,
    test_accuracy=accuracy_value,
    min_accuracy_threshold=85.0,  # Deploy if accuracy >= 85%
    mongo_uri=mongo_uri
)
```

Adjust the `min_accuracy_threshold` to control when models are deployed to production.

### Hyperparameter Optimization

Customize HPO settings in the `bilstm_hyperparam_optimizer_github` function:

```python
# Increase trials for more thorough search
total_max_trials=100

# Modify search space
UniformParameterRange('General/base_lr', min_value=0.0001, max_value=0.01)
DiscreteParameterRange('General/hidden_size', values=[128, 192, 256, 320, 384, 512])
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues

If you encounter MongoDB connection issues in the pipeline, check the following:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGODB_DATABASE` are properly set in GitHub Secrets.

2. **Connection Timeout**: The system now uses more robust connection parameters with proper timeout settings:

   ```python
   # Recent updates to MongoDB connection code
   self.client = MongoClient(
       self.uri,
       server_api=ServerApi('1'),
       serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000,  # 5 second timeout
       connectTimeoutMS=10000,         # 10 second connection timeout
       socketTimeoutMS=45000,          # 45 second socket timeout
       ssl=True,
       ssl_cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE,  
       tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=True
   )
   ```

3. **CI/CD Environment**: The system now checks for environment variables first before attempting to load from `.secrets` file, making it more robust in CI/CD environments.

4. **Certificate Issues**: If you encounter SSL/TLS certificate issues, the code now handles this with proper settings.

5. **Debugging**: More detailed error logging has been added to help diagnose connection issues.

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "MongoDB URI not provided" | Set MONGODB_URI in GitHub Secrets or environment variables |
| "Could not connect to MongoDB" | Check network connectivity, firewall settings, and MongoDB Atlas IP access list |
| "not authorized" | Verify credentials in the connection string |
| "SSL handshake failed" | The system now disables strict certificate validation for CI/CD |
| "Model file not found" | Check the file paths and ensure model files are saved correctly |

## üßπ Repository Maintenance

To clean up unnecessary files and keep only Guardian pipeline essentials:

```bash
# Cleans up hyperparameter files from previous runs
python Guardian_pipeline_github.py --cleanup
```

## üîí Security

- All credentials are stored as GitHub Secrets
- MongoDB connection strings are never committed to the repository
- The `.secrets` file is included in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for local development
